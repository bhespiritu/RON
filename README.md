# Improvement List

## 1. Bug Fixes

Show stopping bug fixes and minor bug fixes.

We fixed a number of major and minor bugs that were pointed out in both alpha and beta feedback. The player no longer sticks to walls or gets stuck on bosses. The bosses also now does not spawn above the elevator. The player’s bullets no longer collide with items. The player can now restart correctly. Left and right sprites are now the correct color. The player no longer spawns on top of the main boss. We also fixed the skybox of the final stage. We also fixed the killboxes on the rooftop so that it's guaranteed to kill the player.

## 2. Overhauled Item Shop

Additional content.

To improve the variability of the game, the player no longer has access to all of the items in the item shop. Instead, they can only buy a subset of each type of item, making each run more varied since you can’t depend on being able to buy the same items. The player may also now buy as many of each passive item as they want.

## 3. Narrative

More dialogue / narrative.

There is now an opening narration providing the game a basic story and objective. The player now has a motivation for fighting the various enemies throughout the stages. There is a reason for going through the game to ultimately beat the final boss. Throughout the game, we also added in dialogue pop-ups to better inform players what is happening.

## 4. UI Overhaul

dditional Animations.

We have added a series of UI elements to make the game more understandable and clear. One of the most important new UI elements is boss health bars. The mini bosses and the final boss now have a health bar, making it clear how much progress you have made in the fight. Additionally, there are now popups when you pick up an item, telling you its name and what it does. Finally, we added indicators for when the player can use their left and right click abilities, making it more clear that secondary right click abilities exist.

## 5. Sound Tweaks

Minor bug fixes.

We addressed some concerns that were made about sound, primarily by tweaking the “enemy detected sound” so that it is less annoying. It plays less and plays at different pitches. We also made it so all player sounds play at different pitches, making things sound a bit more varied. We also added elevator dings to make it clear when the elevator arrives.

## 6. 3rd Stage

Additional Content.

We added a 3rd stage to the game to make it feel more complete and give the player more time to play the game to get more powerful to beat the final boss.

## 7. Set Pieces

Additional Content.

To make stages a little more dynamic and interesting, we added what we call “set pieces.” These set pieces are dynamic moving parts of levels, such as moving platforms or jump pads. They allow the player to do more interesting things within a level.

## 8. Active Item Reworks

Additional Content.

We’ve made a substantial change to gameplay by making it so that all the active items, that is to say left-click guns, act differently from each other. This makes gameplay feel more varied from run to run as you use the different weapons. Instead of just doing different damage, each gun behaves differently. The freeze gun lets you trade off of slow movement speed for increased damage dynamically, the random gun reflects off of walls, the hand cannon arcs and bounces around, and the assault rifle fires faster than any other gun.

## 9. Passive Item Rebalancing

Additional Content.

All of the passive items have been rebalanced to make the game feel more balanced and make the central dynamic of scaling up with difficulty feel better.

## 10. Visual Changes

Add particle effects.

We’ve added multiple visual effects to make various elements of the game more clear. Drones lasers now disappear when they’re dead, we’ve added hazard signs to make jump pads clearer, we’ve added new bullet sprites for each of the weapons, we’ve added money effects when you kill enemies, and we’ve given all items an outlined shader to help them stand out from the background. We added the a visual shockwave to knockback. We added some misc particle effects to things like enemy damage.
